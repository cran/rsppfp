#' @title igraph Shortest Path
#'
#' @description A original node N_i can appear on a transformed gStar as different N_i* equivalent
#'    nodes. Therefore, this becomes a limitation when searching for a shortest path inside gStar.
#'    As a result: all N_i* need to be considered as possible destination nodes when looking for
#'    the shortest path. This function is a wrapper for this behavior, providing a straightforward
#'    implementation using igraph capabilities. However, it aims to provide
#'    guidance on how to build a similar algorithm for different path-finding algorithms.
#'    
#'    It is important to mention that new nodes are only considered as destination nodes, and they
#'    are not search for origin nodes. This is because N* nodes can only be reached after traveling
#'    through gStar nodes. For example, a node \code{"f|e|r"} is actually indicating that \code{"r"}
#'    has been reached after traveling through the nodes \code{"f"} and \code{"e"}.

#' @family igraph Integration
#'
#' @param g A gStar digraph in data frame format, translated using one of the available functions.
#'   The weight or cost attribute of each arc of the graph must be stored in a specific column
#'   named \code{weight}.
#' @param origin The name of the starting node from G for the path. It must be written as it
#'    appears in G, and it is preferable to use a character format, but this can also be of
#'    any simple type. No lists or vectors are allowed.
#' @param dest The name of the destination node from G for the path. It must be written as it
#'    appears in G, and it is preferable to use a character format, but this can also be of any
#'    simple type. No lists or vectors are allowed.  
#' @param weightColName The name of the weight column used in the dataframe. If the column does not
#'    exist, a name _must_ be provided so that a new weight column is generated.     
#'
#' @return The shortest path from \code{origin} node to \code{dest} node, calculated in G*, to
#'    include the forbidden paths. It uses igraph's functionalities.
